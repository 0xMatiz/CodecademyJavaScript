# CodecademyJavaScript
In this repository i will be posting everything i am learning and that i have learned so far in codecademy..
Im doing this because i had some trouble with the time i am gonna have for doing the 30 Days of JavaScript per day.
So instead i thought that i could post what i learned on codecademy prior to doing the challenge, and whenever i have time to continue the challenge, ill do it.
