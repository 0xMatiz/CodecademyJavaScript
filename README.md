# CodecademyJavaScript
In this repository i will be posting everything i am learning and that i have learned so far in codecademy..
Im doing this because i had some trouble with the time i am gonna have for doing the 30 Days of JavaScript per day.
So instead i thought that i could post what i learned on codecademy prior to doing the challenge, and whenever i have time to continue the challenge, ill do it.

If you find that there are modules that aren't here, it is because i didn't know how to use GitHub when i started the course. So im currently typing the code on VSC to start posting it on here.

I've just finished the 100% of the free content from the course of JavaScript, i plan to pay for codecademy in order to do all the proyects but by now, i can find ideas of proyects to do on internet rathere than using my free 7 days of codecademy on this. 
What i plan to do is doing all the free content i can, practice a lot, and then do all the proyects at once and receive the certificate for each one xd.
I don't know if it works that way but i will definetely find out.
