/* - LOOPS -
 LESSON 1 - Repeating Tasks Manually

1.Create the variable vacationSpots, and assign its value to an array of three strings naming places you’d like to visit.
Write your code below */
let vacationSpots = ['Japan','New York', 'Germany'];

/* 2. Next, console.log() each item in vacationSpots. Since we don’t know loops yet, we have to console.log() each element in the array separately. */
console.log(vacationSpots[0]);
console.log(vacationSpots[1]);
console.log(vacationSpots[2]);

/* 3. Nice work! Now imagine that the vacation list had 100 places on it— logging each array element to the console by hand would be a tedious task! In the next exercise, we will learn how to make things more efficient with for loops. */

//Okay i imagine 😂
